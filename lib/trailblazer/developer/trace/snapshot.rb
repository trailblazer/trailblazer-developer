module Trailblazer::Developer
  module Trace

    # Snapshot keeps an inspected version of each ctx variable.
    # We figure out if a variable has changed by using `variable.hash` (works
    # even with deeply nested structures).
    #
    # By keeping "old" versions, we get three benefits.
    # 1. We only need to call {inspect} once on a traced variable. Especially
    #    when variables are complex structures or strings, this dramatically speeds
    #    up tracing, from same-ish to factor 5!
    # 2. The content sent to our debugger is much smaller which reduces network load
    #    and storage space.
    # 3. Presentation becomes simpler as we "know" what variable has changed.
    #
    # Possible problems: when {variable.hash} returns the same key even though the
    #                    data has changed.
